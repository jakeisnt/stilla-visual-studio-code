> `Still` :: A quiet, introverted theme that stays out of your way.

## Maintenance
When changing or tweaking a color, the best procedure is generally to find and replace the old color with the new color (unfortunately, JSON doesn't allow variable declarations...).

## This is the README for your extension "stilla"
You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
